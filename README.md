## Requirements

## Use 

Launch clock.py with a command window, or using Python, as the keyboard inputs needed to toggle pause and display are not supported by most IDEs, like VSCode.   
  
On launch, programm will ask for an alarm/custom current time with hh:mm:ss format.  
Press enter to skip and set no alarm / default local time respectively.  

To pause and resume the clock, type P on the keyboard  
To toggle between 24H and 12AM/PM display, type M on the keyboard  
To set an alarm at any time while the clock is running, press A on the keyboard
